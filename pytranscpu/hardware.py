===========

Hardware simulation primitives.

This module is the lowest layer of the project. It knows neither CPU,
instruction nor assembler. It only provides the abstractions needed to
build things up tier by tier:

    transistors
        |
        v
    logic gates
        |
        v
    multiplexers / adders
        |
        v
    registers / memory
        |
        v
    ALU
        |
        v
    CPU

Logical model
-------------

    0       LOW / GND
    1       HIGH / VCC
    None    Z / high impedance

The model is deliberately numeric and pedagogical. It does not try to
simulate real voltages, currents, capacitances or physical latencies.

    Base class for every hardware component.

    A component can be:

    - composite: built from other components.

    A component does not necessarily hold state. Sequential components
    manage their state in dedicated classes.

    The cost of a component is *derived* from its attributes. Every
    ``Component`` instance stored on the component, directly or inside
    a list or tuple attribute, is counted as a sub-component, and the
    counts are summed recursively. Composite components therefore
    declare nothing at all: a gate made of transistors automatically
    reports the sum of its transistors.

    Leaf components declare their own cost with the ``transistors``
    and ``memory_bits`` class attributes.

    ``memory_bits`` counts physical storage cells. It is declared on
    the smallest storage primitive, the SR latch. A master-slave flip
    flop is made of two latches, so it counts two physical bits.
